# 0. Index.

# 1. Introduction.

First, let's explain why there is a topology chapter in an analysis book.

As we asserted in other chapter, Analysis is the study of the *limits*, and the limit is essentially a statement about closeness. Then, the *Topology* is the branch which isolates and study the notions of closeness, proximity or continuity in abstract without appealing to distances or metrics.

Hence, this topology chapter brings to the reader a precise vocabulary-kit in which the terms limit, continuity or convergence have complete sense. The hardest theorems of elementary analysis are, in fact, topological theorems.

Analysis emerges to give foundation to Calculus works which, before analysis, it worked with a non-fully-deployed but intuitive idea of limit, then called *infinitesimals*; $dx$. Primordial analysis stablished a first *limit* definition that, despite being rude, was mathematically accurate:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \forall\,\varepsilon>0\;\;\exists\,\delta>0\;:\;0<|x-a|<\delta\implies |f(x)-L| < \varepsilon $$

Observe that this first definition involves the metric, this means that this limit idea is not property of the real field, is property of the space in which a proximity notion exists which is what the topology studies.

Later, topologic concepts rebuilt the limit concept in a simplier way, disregarding metrics and epsilons and using heavy geometric nuance.

Thus, there is three level of abstractions. First let's barely introduce what the *open sets* are; an open set is a set in which all its points are interior points. Intuitively, this means that the set does not contain its boundary, allowing you to approach any element without stepping outside the set's limits.

Thus:

- A **topologic space**; is a set $X$ along witha a collection of open subsets following three axioms.

    <br>

- A **metric space**; is a particular case of toplogic space in which the open subsets gets generated with the metric. In some sense, an open set is a set in which every element has an "enviroment" of elements (defined by the metric) within the set, like a circule or sphere centered in the element which enterly falls inside the set.

- A **euclidean space**
